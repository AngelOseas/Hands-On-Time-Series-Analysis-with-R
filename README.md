**Perform time series analysis and forecasting using R**

## What is this book about?
Time series analysis is one of the key fields in statistical programming and it comprises of various techniques to analyze data to extract meaningful insights and other valuable characteristics from data. This book will be introducing readers to some powerful methods such as prediction and forecasting with Time Series Analysis using R. The book will equip you with tools and techniques which will let you confidently think through the problem.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* The practical & easy to follow codes to evaluate the high-performance forecasting solution.
* Develop a basic understanding of visualizing time series data in order to derive better insights.
* Explore auto-correlation and gain knowledge of statistical techniques to deal with non-stationary time series.
* Learn to build a Bayesian Structural Time Series model with external variables.
* Discover how to use time series analysis tools from the stats, forecast and astsa packages.
* Understand how to work with different time series formats in R (“ts”, “mts”, “xts” and “zoo” objects)
* Get introduced to traditional time series models like; ARIMA, Holt-Winters, ETS, etc.
